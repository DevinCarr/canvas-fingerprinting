# Canvas Fingerprinting

Canvas Fingerprinting is fully explained by [this paper](https://hovav.net/ucsd/dist/canvas.pdf). This 
website is just an attempt to explain it in more detail with step-by-step and demos.

## Also

[Fingerprintjs2](https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2) is also a great library that utilizes many
different browser fingerprinting techniques into one big entropy function.

- Also the where I borrowed the Murmur hash implementation from.
